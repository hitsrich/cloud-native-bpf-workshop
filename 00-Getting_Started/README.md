## 00 - Getting Started

Before we get started with the exercises, we need to have all the elements
in place. This directory has a couple of scripts to help you get quickly
set up.

## Creating a Minikube cluster

This assumes that your machine has the necessary packages for using libvirt
already installed, that your user has the right permissions and that you
already have kubectl installed.  [Instructions on how to get there on
Ubuntu or Debian](ubuntu.md)

Install and run minikube by running `./start_minikube.sh`.  This will set
up a minikube instance as described in our [instructions](../minikube.md).
If it works fine, you'll have a cluster ready to use once the script is
done. If there are errors, check the documentation.

You can check that your cluster is running correctly by running `kubectl
get pods -A` and verifying that you have the usual cluster management pods.

**Note**: Minikube doesn't support nested virtualization, so if you want to
run minikube inside a VM, you can do this by passing `--use-driver-none` to
the `./start_minikube.sh` script. This will use the current instance as the
node and is only recommended for a disposable VM. You will need to install
the kernel headers for the current OS. If running Ubuntu or Debian, you'll
also need to install the `conntrack` package if it's not installed and
possibly change some settings, depending on the specific version you're
running.

## Using a Gardener shoot cluster with Garden Linux

Ths assumes you have access to a Gardener dashboard to create shoot clusters
with Garden Linux.

## Adding the Inspektor Gadget plugin

Install Inspektor Gadget by running `./get_inspektor_gadget`. This will
download and install `kubectl-gadget` either by using krew, if you have it
enabled, or by downloading it and copying it to the same path as `kubectl`.
If there are any errors, check the Inspektor Gadget [installation
docs](https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget/blob/master/Documentation/install.md).

You can check that it's working correctly by running `kubectl gadget help`.

## Adding the gadget pod to the cluster

Once you have the cluster running and the gadget plugin installed, you can
add the gadget pod to your cluster by running:

```
kubectl gadget deploy | kubectl apply -f -
```

And then check that the pod was deployed and is working correctly with:

```
kubectl get pod -n kube-system
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=gadget --tail=-1 | head -19
```
